//! Test suite for `regge.rs` / `regge_pi.rs`.
//!
//! Three tiers, cheapest/most-fundamental first:
//!  1. Geometry sanity: a single regular tetrahedron's dihedral angle
//!     matches the known closed-form value arccos(1/3).
//!  2. Flatness / triangulation-independence: a literally flat region of
//!     R^3 (a cube), triangulated two different ways (5 tets vs 6 tets),
//!     must both yield deficit angle ~0 at every interior hinge and Regge
//!     action ~0 -- and must agree with each other. This is the concrete,
//!     honestly-scoped test of "diffeomorphism invariance": Regge calculus
//!     does NOT have exact continuum diffeomorphism invariance at finite
//!     lattice spacing (this is well documented in the literature -- e.g.
//!     Hamber & Williams' work on the discrete Bianchi identity), but the
//!     one exact discrete residue of it is that different triangulations
//!     of the *same flat geometry* must give the same (zero) curvature and
//!     action. That is what is tested here -- not full diffeomorphism
//!     invariance, which this module does not claim.
//!  3. Path integral sanity: the Metropolis sampler thermalizes, keeps a
//!     sane (non-degenerate) acceptance rate, and its mean action responds
//!     in the expected direction to the coupling kappa (stronger coupling
//!     -> configurations pulled harder toward the flat/low-|S| region).
